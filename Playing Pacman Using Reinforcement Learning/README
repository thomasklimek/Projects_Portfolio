To Generate Graphs From Part 1:
1. In the main function of RunTest call the function compareRL();
2. Repeat this for different RL algorithms and feature sets
3. This data was averaged and plotted using python and google sheets

To Generate Graphs From Part 2:
1. In the main function of RunTest call the function tamer();
2. To train the agent use the "1" key for positive reward, and use the "2" key for negative reward
3. This data was plotted using python and google sheets
