### Gambler's Problem Reinforcement Learning
Solving the Gambler's Problem using Reinforcement Learning algorithm of value itteration. Implemented using Python.

### Generative Adversarial Network for EEG Data
Implementation of a GAN for generating realistic synthetic EEG data. This was a final project for a deep learning class in which we experimented with creating a GAN to augment small EEG datasets in attempt to increase classification accuracy. Implemented using Python, and PyTorch.

### Genetic Search Algorithm
Implementation of a genetic search algorithm in C++ to solve the backpack problem.

### Harmony Generation Using Reinforcement Learning
This project uses reinforcement learning algorithms such as q-learning and sarsa to tackle the problem of real time musical accompaniment. Implemented as a final project for my Reinforcement Learning course, we frame the act of playing music as a reinforcement learning problem and use Python to implement a system for creating chords based on feedback from existing songs.

### K-Arm Bandit Reinforcement Learning
Implementation of basic reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal policy for the K-Arm Bandit Problem.

### Linear Regression and 2-Layer Neural Net
Practice implementation of basic Linear Regression and a 2-layer fully connected neural network in TensorFlow and classification of CIFAR-10 data.

### Logistic Regression for classifying Titanic and Mnist
From scratch logistic regression implemented using Python, Numpy, and autograd for calculating gradients.
