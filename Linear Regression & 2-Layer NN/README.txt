# Comp 150-09 DNN: Assiginment 1 

* This folder contains files for assignment 1. In this assignment, you will get familiar with Tensorflow and then implement a neural network
with tensorflow.  


* There are two tasks. 
    1. In the first task, you need to construct a linear regression model with Tensorflow. 
    2. In the second task, you need to construct a two-layer neural network with Tensorflow. 
You can skip the first task if you are already familiar with Tensorflow or other packages for deep learning (e.g. PyTorch). If you do so, 
the points you get from the second task will be scaled to the range [0, 100] and used as your points of assignment 1.  


* In the first task, please run the notebook `linear_regression.ipynb` with the following command

> ipython notebook linear_regression.ipynb

and then follow instructions there. There are 7 problems, each of which worth 4 points. If you work out all problems correctly, you will 
get the output as `linear_regression.pdf`. 


* In the second task, please run the notebook `two_layer_net.ipynb` by the following command

> ipython notebook two_layer_net.ipynb

and then follow instructions there. Basically, you need to implement the neural network in the framework given in  
`implementations/b_neural_net.py` and then use the neural network to solve a toy classification problem and the classification problem 
of CIFAR-10. 


* Finally, you need to submit your code and the pdf file saved from your notebook. When we grade your code, we check your result in the pdf
file as well as your code. If your code cannot generate the result of a problem in your pdf file, you will get zero point for that problem. 
Actually, if you follow instructions in the notebook and finish all tasks, you have a very high chance to get full points. 




[The second task is adapted from a problem in the first assignment of Stanford cs231n with permission. I'd like to acknowledge instructors 
of that course.]
